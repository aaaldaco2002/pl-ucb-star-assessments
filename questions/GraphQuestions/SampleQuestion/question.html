<p>For the graph below, use Kruskal’s algorithm to find the MST. The number on each edge is the
  weight, and the letter is a unique label you should use in your answer to specify that edge. Provide
  the edges in the order they’d be found by Kruskal’s algorithm. Break any ties using the
  alphabetical label. Use the blanks below. You may not need all blanks. Give your answer in terms
  of the alphabetical labels, e.g. if Kruskal’s starts with the edge between vertices 3 and 4, you would
  write H in the first blank.</p>
